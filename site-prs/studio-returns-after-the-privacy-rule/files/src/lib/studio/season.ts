// src/lib/studio/season.ts — "The floor keeps every mark": the whole season of the house on ONE
// stage floor, derived from committed data alone.
//
// The Studio's own grammar (ADR 0010) says the floor keeps every strike. This generator takes that
// at its word and extends it to every OUTCOME the house has produced, because a strike is not the
// only thing the floor remembers:
//
//   · a PREMIERE is a lit position — a hard-edged pool with the work's title in Didone capitals
//     (hard-edged on purpose: Frank rejected the soft gradient in 2026-07-16, "hässlicher gold
//     glow", and the plotted light stayed);
//   · a STRIKE is a taped X with its verbatim reason;
//   · a RETURN is the human eye sending a work back — a violet arc curving off the public side of
//     the floor and down into the production area, one per return, numbered in Roman;
//   · a WITHDRAWAL is a struck spotlight: the pool stays on the floor, unlit, with an X drawn
//     THROUGH it. Not an error state and never a warning red — the house withdrew One Tap itself,
//     in writing, after the eye rejected three stagings. That is a completed honest act, and the
//     floor keeps it in the house's own curtain colour.
//
// Time runs left to right (a season does), and the vertical axis is the stage's own depth: the lit
// positions play downstage under the curtain line, the struck positions sit further back on the
// dark floor, and the production area is the band at the upstage edge that a returned work goes
// back into.
//
// Pure and deterministic, the same contract as stage.ts and score.ts: same inputs ⇒ byte-identical
// output, no clock reads, no Math.random. Every position is derived (dataviz/geometry.ts: FNV-1a
// hash → offset → fixed-iteration relaxation), so a rebuild is never a re-layout and a diff of the
// built figure shows real data changes only.
//
// NOTHING here invents a fact. Titles, dates and the WITHDRAWN state come from the works' own
// meta.json; strike reasons and their sources come from the curated kill list verbatim; returns are
// found by matching the chronicle's own sentences (see RETURN_PATTERNS) and the quoted fragment is
// carried through unedited or not at all.
